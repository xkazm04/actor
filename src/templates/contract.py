- standard: 15-20 findings with balanced coverage of all areas
- deep: 25-30 comprehensive findings with full investigation support

CRITICAL: Prioritize RED_FLAG and SUSPICIOUS_ELEMENT findings. If you identify
potential fraud indicators, ensure they are captured even if confidence is moderate.
False negatives (missing fraud) are worse than false positives (flagging non-issues).
